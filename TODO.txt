* Handle Trailers.
* Add configurable limits (max headers, max http header size, max url size)
* Better error handling for when limits are hit (max headers, max buffer size)

Optimizations:
* Shared reference counting buffers.
* Create hm_message object to hold status/url/method/http version/headers.
  This will allow request handlers to ignore fields they don't need.
